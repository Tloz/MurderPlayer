MurderPlayer
============

(please note that thhis README.m is outdated)

##WTFIT?

MurderPlayer is a programm that simplify the processing of murder parties. Only for MJ, and mostly for beginners, as most of the fun comes in doing this by the hand

The first version is dedicated to one particular story. As I go coding, my goal is to make it compatible with every sotry of the same kind:
Investigation with a three level of quality report system, the possibility to copy the last report a player got, and the possibility to intercept the next report a player would get

##Improvements

As the first version is very basic (player can investigate, copy and intercept reports), the plan is to code everything that could be needed for the beginner MJ:
- An override system for the player state
- A log
- A saving system
- The possibility to view data on the story
- The capability to use a different story than the one implemented in the source code
